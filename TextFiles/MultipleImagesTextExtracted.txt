Train to Maximize Autopsy Usability

Reduce your learning curve and accelerate your forensic
examinations’ efficiency when you attend Basis Technology's
1-day Autopsy training course. Taught by Brian Carrier, who
thas been involved with Autopsy since its inception in 2000, the
course describes how to use Autopsy to execute an optimal
end-to-end digital investigation, as well as what the tool is,
doing behind the scenes.

Enhanced Commercial Support

Get enterprise-level backing for your investigative needs.
While Autopsy's volunteer user community can help with basic
problems, many labs want the assurance that their issues will
be promptly addressed. Basis Technology provides support ir
case you encounter problems. This service allows you to engage
directly with Basis engineers to ensure the issues are quickly
diagnosed and addressed.

Extensible through Add-On Modules

Different organizations have different needs and workflows.
‘Autopsy includes a standard set of modules to cover a broad
array of investigative use cases, but was designed to be
extensible.
